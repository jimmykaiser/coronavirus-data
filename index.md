## Positivity rate over the past week by neighborhood

This map displays the percentage of Covid-19 tests that were positive over the last seven days for each New York City zip code. 

While it is possible to view cumulative positivity rates by zip code since March on the NYC Dept. of Health's [data page](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page), this map shows changes in the past week so recent trends are evident.
